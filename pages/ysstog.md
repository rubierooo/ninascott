  key: You Should See the Other Guy
  order: 2
---
***You Should see the Other Guy*** (2014 - 2021) was a queer led theatre company ran by Nina Scott and Emer Mary Morris. We began as housing activists with Focus E15 Campaign, supporting people at risk of gentrification and regeneration, but our work later broadened to include supporting climate activists, the queer community and many more.

Our ethos is *DIY Theatre: DIY Resistance* and our work sets out to demystify art and demystify activism. Our methods are non-hierarchical, accessible and queer as we know these philosophies are integral when working to deconstruct and reconstruct systems of oppression. We believe theatre has the power to spark personal and social transformation and be vehicle for community action.

We make work that is...
- Radically inclusive: we encourage participation from women and non-binary people from all backgrounds, ages and abilities
- Non-elitist: everyone is paid the same and child care is provided so that mothers can be part of our cast and crew.
- Accessible: on estates tickets are free and at theatres they are subsidised. Workshop participants get food and travel expenses.
## A bit of history...
Our debut production, *Land of the Three Towers* tells the story of the 2014 Focus E15 Occupation of four empty flats on Carpenters Estate, in which we were core campaigners. The occupation criticised Newham council for leaving perfectly decent homes empty and demanded they repopulate the Estate. It ran for two weeks and resulted in 23 homes being reopened for people who need them. Using exclusive documentary footage we tell the story of this historical moment in the fight for "Social Housing, Not Social Cleansing!"

*"From a new generation of thinkers who have, in this inaugural work, taken theatre in a whole new direction."* ***** International Times

In January 2016 *Land of the Three Towers* enjoyed a sold out run on Carpenters Estate as part of Camden People’s Theatres festival, ‘Whose London is it Anyway’. Our audience feedback stated that 92% of people were more likely to get involved in local housing campaigns after seeing the show. Our coinciding workshops included: Know Your Rights’, ‘Theatre of the Oppressed’ and ‘Eviction Resistance’. Our immersive exhibition told the story of Carpenters Estate, Cressingham Gardens and Silchester Estate, and their fight to save their homes.

The full script of *Land of the Three Towers: Vol I* is published in [Radical Housing: Art, Struggle, Care](https://networkcultures.org/blog/publication/radical-housing-art-struggle-care/) (journal ed. Ana Valencia, 2021)

*Land of the Three Towers: Vol 2* was developed in May, 2018 when we worked with a new group of women with lived experience of housing oppression, including young people from Silchester Estate and Carpenters Estate. The play was performed to sold out audiences at London estates resisting demolition and Brighton Fringe.

In 2020-2021 we worked with Eviction Resistance Network and London Renters Union to create workshops which use theatre to explore alternatives to housing oppression. Our workshop series *Theatre of the Oppressed for Housing Justice* and *Theatre of the Oppressed for Renters Rights* pooled the knowledge of renters, people who have experienced homelessness, architects and activists and explored Theatre of the Oppressed as a tool for movement building and overcoming oppression.
