***Womb with a View*** (2016-2018) *is an immersive venue that gives birth to new ideas, and an interactive performance that gives birth to YOU.*

*Travel down a fallopian tube, party with some adoring sperm, enjoy the luxurious velvety interior, start a universe, divide your cells, divide your cells again, divide your cells some more times, sing pop hits into an umbilical cord, pray to mother above, grow your kidneys, wiggle your new toes, be the creator, be the created and make yourself at home because this is all there is, right?*

*...right?*

WINNER: AIF Unique Festival Arena, 2017
