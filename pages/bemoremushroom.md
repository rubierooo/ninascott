*Kid does not 'fit in’ to Mum's pristine garden. Where everything has its place. Where there’s no room for anything 'peculiar'. Like Kid. And like the giant yellow Chanterelle mushroom that appears one afternoon behind the washing line emitting bubbles, disco lights and... is that... a compilation of queer pop hits remixed to a satisfying techno beat?*

*When Mum goes on a mission of mushroom destruction Kid must befriend the musical spores, ride the mycelial network under the garden and visit 'Chanterelle’s’: a place with no Morel's (that's a mushroom joke) where the floors are sticky, the clientele is icky and the top class cabaret performances leave Kid with more questions than answers.*

**Be More Mushroom** is a raucous, educational stage musical and workshop series about what fungi can teach us about ourselves and the world around us.

Be More Mushroom was conceived by Nina Scott and created in collaboration with Dan de la Motte and a group of queer mycologists, performers, artists and musicians. This was made possible by funding from Arts Council England and support from St. Margaret's House as part of their Artist in Residence Programme.
